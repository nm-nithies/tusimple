To fuse StdDev and InvStdDev into LayerNorm, the ReduceMean axes attribute must satisfy the following condition:

Condition:
Axes[0] + len(Axes) == len(Input_shape)

In cases where the ReduceMean axes do not align with the input channel dimension, the input channel dimension and axes attribute can be modified to meet the above condition. This can be achieved by applying a transpose operation before and after the LayerNorm.
