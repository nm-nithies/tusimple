The error indicates a mismatch in the dimensions of the input tensor and the scale/bias parameters for the LayerNormalization node. The tensor's size is 64 along the specified axis, but the scale and bias sizes are 80, which must be corrected to match 64.

Create a function to verify if the scale and bias values are compatible for broadcasting.
