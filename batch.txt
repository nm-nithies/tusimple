To Fuse StdDev & InvStdDev into layernorm  Reduce Mean axes attribute need to Â match the below condition

Condition:

Axes[0] + len(Axes) == len(Input_shape)




In some cases the reduce mean axes does not support with the pattern  Input channel dimmension

If the Input channel dimension and axes attribute can be changed to match the above condition. Apply transpose front and back of LayerNorm
