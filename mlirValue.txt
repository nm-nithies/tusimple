The ProcessScfParallelPrivatePass adds an alloca_scope to scf.parallel loops to ensure that memory allocated inside the loop body is private to each thread. This prevents memory sharing among threads and ensures correct parallel execution in multi-threaded environments. 


The ProcessKrnlParallelClausePass integrates the parameters from KrnlParallelClauseOp into the enclosing OpenMP parallel constructs, such as setting the number of threads and processor binding. Once the relevant information is transferred, the Krnl clause operation is removed from the IR.

Pass for analyzing unknown dimension in ONNX operations.
  implements the lowering of frontend operations to a combination of
 Krnl IR and standard operations.

pass for lowering to Stablehlo IR.
