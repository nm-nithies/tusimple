The C++ code rewrites ONNXSumOp during MLIR transformation, handling sums with multiple inputs. The Python code replaces Sum with Add operations in a computational graph only when there are exactly two inputs. Although both transform Sum to Add, they operate in different contexts and have different input constraints.
