Replace Sum layer with Add layer. 

 
SumToAddPattern  MLIR pass  rewrites ONNXSumOp during MLIR transformation, handling sums with multiple inputs.  
 
ReplaceSum pass replaces Sum with Add operations in a computational graph only when there are exactly two inputs. Although both transform Sum to Add, they operate in different contexts and have different input constraints.
