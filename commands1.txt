    Arguments:
    ----------
    reference_data_path: Path to the reference data file

    This method extracts image name and annotation lanes for lane_detection TuSimple dataset.
    If the input is a dictionary, it returns it as is. Otherwise, it reads and parses the data from the provided file path.

    :return: A dictionary containing image names and their corresponding annotation lanes.

    """
    Arguments:
    ----------
    pred: Predicted lane coordinates for evaluation.
    gt:  Ground truth lane coordinates for evaluation.
    y_samples:  Y-axis sample points corresponding to the lane points.
    running_time: Time taken for lane detection. If the running time exceeds a threshold, it affects the evaluation.

    This method evaluates the performance of lane detection by calculating accuracy, false positives (FP), and false negatives (FN). 
    It compares the predicted lanes against the ground truth using a pixel distance threshold and lane angle.

    :return: Tuple containing:
        - Accuracy: (float) The ratio of matched lanes over the ground truth.
        - FP: (float) False positive rate, the fraction of predicted lanes that don't match any ground truth.
        - FN: (float) False negative rate, the fraction of ground truth lanes that are not matched.
