If the transpose operation [0, 5, 3, 1, 2, 4] is applied, the pattern is fused into a custom SpaceToDepth operator.

This custom SpaceToDepth operator, from the domain snps.onnx.local, includes a new attribute called Mode, which can be either DCR or CRD:

When transpose([0, 5, 3, 1, 2, 4]) is applied in DCR mode
When transpose([0, 5, 3, 1, 2, 4]) is applied in CRD mode
