Fixed the  issue nps.onnx.local:SpaceToDepth(-1) is not a registered function/op
Complete all MR comments 
Removed the ONNX SpaceToDepth Op and included CRD Mode for nps.onnx.local:SpaceToDepth Op
Retriggered the regression build.  Regression Passed.
 
Tried to legalize the yolov7_e-p6_syncbn_fast_8x16b-300e_coco
I faced this warning and shapes were not updated properply at the end 
[WARNING] Found dynamic Ops. Use ONNX shape inference instead of ONNXRUNTIME inference to generate shape information for each tensor. Note this way sometimes might be buggy.
After setting FORCE_FIX_SHAPE=1, the shapes are updated but the diff remains for TopK layer.
Tried to legalize the model with 4 to 5 images from coco dataset. But still faces max_diff l.
Added comments and regression test for FuseSpaceToDepth pass.
Cleaned and pushed the codes. Triggered the regression build

Nithies:
Added get_SpaceToDepth_primitive_nodes function succesfully in onnx_local_function.py
Fixed the shape issue for Fuse_Space_To_depth pass for different input shapes.
Able to legalize the 4 models with 0 diff (yolox_l_8x8_300e_coco.onnx, yolox_s_8x8_300e_coco.onnx, yolox_tiny_8x8_300e_coco.onnx, yolox_x_8x8_300e_coco.onnx)
But legalization failed for yolov7_e-p6_syncbn_fast_8x16b-300e_coco, yolov7_e-p6_syncbn_fast_8x16b-300e_coco.onnx models

 
Nithies:
Tried to add custom function for SpaceToDepth in  NNAC onnx_local_function.
 
Faced issue INVALID_GRAPH : This is an invalid model. In Node, ("", Reshape, "", -1) : ("input": tensor(float),"",) -> ("_inlfunc_SpaceToDepth_reshape1_out",) , Error Node ()'s input 1 is marked single but has an empty string in the graph
 
Tried to resolve this issue. But Got stuck with this one. Tried to use the TensorDict values for Reshape Op from the original graph.  But failed
The output graph 
For now pushed the code to branch
