The succs of Concat has 5 Gather Node and pred od Concat has 6 layer 
Any possiblity to fuse this @Yvonne



SwirIR
Found and fixed the issue in RemoveNopSlice pass. 
Pushed the code and Triggered the build

Bevformer_tiny_1600x900
Tried to fix the hanggig softmax issue in RemoveSigmoidInverseSigmoid pass
For this Bevformer_tiny_1600x900 generation
It is only generated when using --convert_set_first_nodes, --convert_set_last_nodes placeholder
And I Apologize, I had upload only the 1/4 of the models onnx_data. 
Let me try generate onnx_data for the  whole mod

Tried to replace the slice opertion in the pytorch flowwhich caused multiple (scatternd, where) Ops in onnx
Found the pass where the multiple output are caused (pass - RemoveNopSlice)
After disabling this pass the model has exact one output as the original onnx  
Tried to fix this issue in the RemoveNopSlice pass



SwinIR
  Cheched the output of the onnx model and optimized ouput. Looks similiar
  Yet to find the root cause for the multiple output generation
 
Yolov8 subragph
Found the reason for the IDT build failure
Fixed the issue and pushed to the code. Build passed
