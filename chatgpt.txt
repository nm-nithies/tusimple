### 1. Isolated Subgraph Verification
- A LayerNorm pattern subgraph was sliced and compared with the standalone ONNX LayerNorm OP.
- The outputs from both computations were found to be identical.
- Since the subgraph outputs are identical, the issue is **not** caused by untrained scale and bias parameters.
