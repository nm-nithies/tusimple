Fixed the Falied Nodes issue in legalization
Madesome changes in RemoveTransposeBeforeSoftmax, convert_Softmax_to_NCHW to produce a valid model
Added FuseSplitConvQDQ pass ( (split+transpose+conv+clip+concat) -> conv + clip)
Yet to check correctness and push the code

Fixed the hanging node issues
Fixed the conflit between merging conv weights and bias into single dequantized layer
 

faced an issue 
 Non-zero status code returned while running DequantizeLinear node. Name:'496/Dequantize/duplicated' Status Message: /hdd2/lucia/build_onnxruntime_1.19/onnxruntime/onnxruntime/core/providers/cpu/quantization/quantize_linear.cc:109 void onnxruntime::PrepareForQDQ(const onnxruntime::TensorShape&, const onnxruntime::Tensor&, const onnxruntime::Tensor*, int64_t, int64_t, int64_t&, int64_t&, int64_t&) scale.Shape().NumDimensions() == 1 && scale.Shape()[0] == broadcast_dim was false. For per axis quantization, scale must be 1D tensor with size 528
 
Fixed this by adding scale and zero_point values into dequantized layer for conv layers
Currenty facing max-diff values and shape mismatch for this dequantized layers.


Found the scale and zeropoint values are not merged sequentially to support the input values>
Updated the pass and able to legalize the model 
Added unit_test for this pattern and added comments to pass
Cleaned and pushed the code. Triggered the build. 
Later found some minor bugs shapemismatch in the conv dequantized layer. Fixed it & pushed the code.


Resolved all MR comments and Triggered the build. Build passed
Rebased the MR - https://gitsnps.internal.synopsys.com/dwc_ev/nnsdk/nnac/-/merge_requests/941
Faced merge conflicts. Resolved it and pushed the code. Retriggered the build 
 
For SwinIR
Checked fuse_attention_customized for several output formed in the graph
