Tried to add custom function for SpaceToDepth Op in NNAC onnx_local_function.py​

Encountered an issue with the Reshape node where input 1 (the shape tensor) is either missing or empty, causing an invalid model error.Tried to use TensorDict values from the original graph for the Reshape operation. But faced same error​

Resolved the issue by explicitly adding constant values in onnx_local_function.py​

Able to add SpaceToDepth  custom Op function succesfully in onnx_local_function.py​

Able to legalize the 4 yolo models with 0 diff (yolox_l_8x8_300e_coco.onnx, yolox_s_8x8_300e_coco.onnx, yolox_tiny_8x8_300e_coco.onnx, yolox_x_8x8_300e_coco.onnx) with the applied custom SpaceToDepth Op​

But legalization failed for yolov7_e-p6_syncbn_fast_8x16b-300e_coco, yolov7_e-p6_syncbn_fast_8x16b-300e_coco.onnx models and faced max_diff​

Faced a warning, Dynamic Ops detected. ONNX shape inference is used instead of ONNXRUNTIME in legalization and the shapes are not updated properly at the end of the graph ​

After enabling FORCE_FIX_SHAPE=1, shapes are updated, but still faced max_diff values in the TopK layer.​

Tried to legalize these model with random values and  4 to 5 images values from coco dataset. But still faces max_diff​

Added regression test for the FuseSpaceToDepth Pass. Faced nps.onnx.local:SpaceToDepth(-1) is not a registered function/op issue​

Fixed the issue after adding local functions defnition into the model ​

Added a new attribute(Mode) for custom SpaceToDepth Op and removed the Onnx SpaceToDepth Op from FuseSpaceToDepth pass for Pattern1​

Resolved all MR Comments. Retriggered the regression build. Build Passed
