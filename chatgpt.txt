I cloned the MobileViTv3 repository to run inference but encountered multiple import issues because it requires switching to a specific commit. Unfortunately, this requirement is not mentioned in the README.

I encountered a "No module" issue for main_eval when using the produced Python executable, so I ran the main_eval.py file directly instead.
