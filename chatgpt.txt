NITHIES:
Yolo_Nas 
Reverted the changes made in convert_Mul_to_NCHW Pass
Made changes in the RemoveTransposeBeforeSoftmax Pass. Support both fp32 and quantized model . Pushed the code.
 
SwinIR
Pushed the code . Triggered the build
 
Tried to fix transpose and softmax issues for qdq cut model


NITHIES:
Yolo_NAS
Fixed all regression test failure. Retriggered the build . Build passed
 
SwinIR:
Fixed  keyError issues from (FuseWindowShift, FuseConsecutiveAddReshape). Yet to push the codes.
Tring to apply FuseWindowShift (If possible)
 
Yolo_NAS (For Quantize Model)
Faced dimension mismatch for Mul Op
There is extra transpose applied before the Mul Op. Yet to check where this transpose have been applied.


NITHIES:
For yolo_nas model 
Updated FuseMulIntoConv, convert_Mul_to_NCHW, MoveTransposeToEnd pass 
Cleaned and pushed the code . Triggered the build
For SwinIR 
Tried to fix KeyError for FuseWindowShift FusePrimitivesIntoLayerNorm FuseConsecutiveAddReshape pass



NITHIES:
Added comments for the regression tests for Yolo models
As per priority started working on Yolo-NAS 
Got the same error mentioned in the jira
Found the reason for the legalization failure 
 
 
Due to convert_Mul_to_NCHW pass the mul constant shapes are changed and that does not support with transpose output
 
2.
 
 
Due to FuseMulIntoConv pass, the model give max_diff. As the relu has two subbranch and mul cannot be fused to first conv.
 
3. 
 
There are shape mismatch for all these transpose
Yet to resolve these issues.
