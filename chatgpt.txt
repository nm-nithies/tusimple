NITHIES
Resolved All Mr comments for GoogleNetand pushed the code
Uploaded the convnext_tbest_dy_optimized.onnx best_dy_optimized.onnx iny model in onnx_models_repo 
Completed repo setup for Nafnet using Docker
Tried to export the model but faced Python operator LayernormFunction issue. 
Currently trying to resolve it

NITHIES:
Fixed the Python operator LayernormFunction issue. Removed the LayernormFunction class and replaced its code functionality in the forward function . Verified its output correctness
Able to export the NAFNet model.
While legalizing this model faced large max_diff values.
Passes causing large diff  -- FuseMulAddIntoNormalization, FuseAddIntoSuccConv
Currently trying to find the root cause for this max_diff


Nithies:
Gone through the MobileVitV3 repository's README
Tried to setup the repository using virtual env but faced undefined symbol error for torch versions and able to setup the repo using docker.
Tried to run inference but encountered multiple import issues because it requires switching to a specific commit. Unfortunately, this requirement is not mentioned in the README.
Using the command provided in the README  to run inference, resulted in  "No module" named  main_eval  and, so I ran the main_eval.py file directly instead.
Able to run the inference after both fix.
Yet to export the model and legaliize it
