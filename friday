 
SAI:
Found the NNAC implementation and analyzed NNAC Accelerator in onnx_mlir within NNSDK .
Found the NNAC Add Op implemention and tried to understand the workflow for generating NNAC IR.

Able to add custom pass(Sub+Div->BN) in NNSDK Onnx_mlir.
Cleaned and pushed the code to branch (fuse_sub_and_div_into_bn)
Faced an legalization issue with mlir::arith::ConstantOP while converting to .so file .Currently debugging it.

SAI:
Tried to resolve legalization issue with arith::ConstantOp while converting to .so file .
Tried to replace arith::ConstantOp in custom_pass.
Replaced arith::Constant with OnnxBuilder::constant but the output from OnnxBuilder::constant does not support BN op.
 
 SAI:
Faced an issue in converting .so file for custom pass 
Issue: failed to legalize operation onnx.BatchNormalization
Replaced onnx.BatchNormalization implementation with onnx.BatchNormalizationInferenceOp.
Using onnx.BatchNormalizationInferenceOp implementation , BatchNormOp did not reflect in MLIR file instead got unrelated Ops.
Currently checking this .
