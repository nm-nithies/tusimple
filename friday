Identified an error in the changes done in FusePrimitivesIntoLayernorm Pass for layernorm Invstd pattern. Made the neccessary corrections.
Able to legalize the model with --legalize_error 0.005(Fused all  small ops patttern into layernorm )
Cleaned the code and pushed it.

Tried to compare the layernorm pattern (Std Dev) with layernorm pattern(Inv stddev)
Created a pytorch code for both layernorm norm pattern (std dev & Inv std) and verified the output with bertsquad_8 scale, bias, eps . Got simialar output for pytorch and onnx runtime. 
Tried to legalize the layernorm pattern(Inv stddev) model. But got max_diff around  2.00. 
Found the scale and bias are not assigned properly and made some changes in FusePrimitivesIntoLayernorm Pass. Able to legalize the Inv stddev pattern with 0 max_diff. 
Able to legalize the entire bertsquad model but the FusePrimitivesIntoLayernorm Pass is only applied for few layernorm pattern (Inv
 StdDev
 


Checked the output between pytorch layernorm(dumped scale,bias, eps values from bertsquad layernorm pattern attributes)  and sliced bertsquad layernorm model pattern . There is a little difff in output values 
Tried to check the output forayern numerator and denominator for  pytorch layernorm with layernnorm pattern(bertsquad)
Numerator
  Sliced the numerator part from bertsquad . Able to get same ouptut for both pytorch and bertsquad layer pattern 
Denominator
   Sliced the denominator part from bertsquad . Did not get the expected output . Used torch.var function 
Also checked the exported pytorch layernorm ouput. But same diff is produced 


Worked on bertsquad_8 legalization
Tried to verifiy the output between pythorch layernorm and bertsquad layernorm pattern
Calcuated the pytorch layernorm with bertsquad scale, bias and eps
Faced an issue in slicing the bertsquad layernorm pattern, did not get the expected graph. Tried with sne4onnx package an onnx-modifier
 
Also tried with nnac onnx cutter , but faced 
[ERROR]: The model cannot run onnxruntime inference! Please recheck the model and the onnx/onnxruntime version as well as your param setup to make sure everything is correct!
 

Could not able to connect IN01,US01,EUDC machines for both Nithies and Sai's credentials
Pushed the code and triggered the built(abnormal dead end for PowOp) in kathir's credentials
Mapped the  bertsquad small ops
Pattern with pytorch layernorm equation
