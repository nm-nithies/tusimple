Able to export the post forward function and verified its correctness
But for this second forward (view transformer) after replacing this bevpoolv2 output as constants in the flow, the tensor data is empty
Inputs shape has been reflected in the output graph in jit_trace.py when dumping the values using numpy file instead of pkl file.Yet visualize in netron.



Tried to export the second forward function (module by module)
I found a submodule(bev_v2_pool) in second forward function(view_transformer) uses a .so file . This so file has been build from .cpp and .cu source files.
While exporting the second forward function , the output graph only contains nodes after this bev_v2_pool module. The code flow in .cpp and .cuda are not traced.
I can able to export the model before this bev_v2_pool module and verified the output .
Currently I am exploring in including .so file in onnx Jit_trace.

Able to export Deformable DeTr with this dims (640x640) and legalized it . Uploaded the exported onnx and optimized model in onnx_model repo
Found the script where the nodes are removed from the graph for the second forward function 
After jit_pass_onnx(), the nodes are removed from the graph 
Currently debugging this.

Able to legalize the 1st module.
Tried to export the 2nd module. But the output graph did not produce the expected Nodes
Made some changes in the view_transfomer forward function and exported the model
Still the output graph did not produce the expected graph. Debugging the reason for missing operators during export
