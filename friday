The FlashOCC model is structured and exported into three distinct components:

pre_bevpool_v2: Represents the initial processing stages before the BEV pooling operation.
bevpool_v2: Encapsulates the BEV pooling operation, a core feature of the model.
post_bevpool_v2: Handles the processing stages following the BEV pooling operation.
