    Arguments:
    ----------
    predictions: list[str]
        List of predicted lane images (usually file names) to evaluate.
    anno_dir: str
        Directory containing ground truth annotation files (e.g., in TuSimple lane detection format).
    reference_data_path: str
        Path to the directory containing test file lists.

    This method calculates the true positives (tp), false positives (fp), and false negatives (fn)
    for lane detection by comparing predicted lanes with ground truth annotations.

    :return: dict
        A dictionary containing 'tp' (true positives), 'fp' (false positives), and 'fn' (false negatives).

    Arguments:
    ----------
    filename: str
        The name of the image file for which detected lanes need to be retrieved.
    predictions: dict
        A dictionary of predictions, where keys are file names (as Path objects or strings),
        and values contain lane detection results for each image.

    This method returns the detected lanes for a given image by searching the predictions dictionary.

    :return: list
        A list of detected lanes for the given image. If the image is not found in predictions, returns an empty list.

    Arguments:
    ----------
    anno_lanes:Ground truth lane coordinates
    detect_lanes: Detected lane coordinates

    This method calculates the similarity matrix between the annotated (ground truth) lanes and the detected (predicted) lanes.
    It returns a list containing information on matched lanes and the calculated true positives (tp), false positives (fp), and false negatives (fn).

    :return: list
        A list in the format [anno_match, tp, fp, _, fn] where:
        - anno_match: List of matched annotation lanes to detection lanes.
        - tp: True positives, the number of correctly detected lanes.
        - fp: False positives, the number of extra lanes detected that don't correspond to ground truth.

        - fn: False negatives, the number of ground truth lanes not detected.

    file_name:  path to the file containing lane annotations.
    This method reads a lane annotation file and returns the lane coordinates.

    :return: list[list[np.ndarray]]
        A list of lanes, where each lane is a list of (x, y) coordinate pairs represented as numpy arrays.
